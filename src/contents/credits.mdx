s:CMS is a project of [LAD: Laboratorio di Archeologia Digitale alla Sapienza](https://purl.org/lad) aimed at providing an easy to use managemet system for rich and multimedial contents, with a particular attention to the pubblicaiton online of research data and geodata hosted in external databases.

It is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a [React](https://react.dev/)-based framework for the creation of [static sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page), completed with custom plugins for a smooth yet rich user experience. We use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), the famous frontend toolkit to built the layout.
